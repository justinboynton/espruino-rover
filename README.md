Building a simple automated rover using Espruino microcontroller. The project
uses the following components:

* Espruino controller
* Olimex basic robot kit ( 2 x motor and plastic mounting board + wheels )
* Motor controller
* Distance Sensor
* Servo
* Bluetooth module

This codebase attempts to provide simple automated control with distance
sensing and basic logic to work out where the rover should move when it comes to
close to obstacles. The rover can also be controlled via bluetooth using a basic
AndroidScript application.
